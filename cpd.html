        <p>
            As part of my education at NTU, I've been asked to keep a journal of extra-curricular activities and
            learning experiences that I've undertaken.
            This is a collection of those activities.

            <h2>Python Basics Workshop</h2>
            <p>
                I have spent the last year out of education.
                The student-run DevSoc workshop was a helpful reintroduction into the world of computer science.
                They provided a platform to get involved and ask question where I wouldn't have in class.

            <h2>SST Welcome Event</h2>
            <p>
                The School of Science and Technology held a welcome event for new students.
                I attended to meet other students and find out more about the school.
                I also received information about the employability and careers services offered by NTU.

            <h2>Bletchley Park</h2>
            <p>
                During Digital Horizons week at NTU, I took part in the excursion to Bletchley Park museum.
                Here I learned of the importance of computer scientists, mathematicians, and linguists during World War II.

            <h2>Fujitsu Presentation</h2>
            <p>
                I had the opportunity to attend a presentation by Fujitsu.
                They spoke about their work in the field of AI and image recognition.
                I found their research to be rather unsettling due to the laws involved, but it was interesting nonetheless.
